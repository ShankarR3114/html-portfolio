<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Introduction & Academic Background</h2>
<p>I am a highly motivated and goal-oriented Computer Science and Engineering student at Kalasalingam University,
  specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. With a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving,
  I have consistently demonstrated a passion for technology and continuous learning. My academic journey has been marked by 
  curiosity,dedication, and a drive to explore real-world applications of computer science in innovative ways.

<h2>Technical Skills & Project Experience</h2>
<p>Over the past year, I have developed a solid command of programming languages such as C and Python. My initial project
  — a medical shop billing system developed using C—allowed me to understand core logic building and system design. Currently,
   I am enhancing my skills through the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp" and the "Complete Web Development 
   Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. As part of my web development journey, I built a portfolio site and several responsive web 
   projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which showcase my growing proficiency in front-end technologies. I actively
   practice coding on HackerRank to strengthen my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
</p>

<h2>Vision, Values & Future Goals</h2>
<p>I believe in lifelong learning, self-discipline, and building a career that blends technology with purpose. My long-term
   vision is to become a high-impact software engineer in a leading global tech firm, contribute to open-source innovation,
   and eventually settle in Australia with a successful and balanced life. I am also focused on enhancing my communication,
   leadership, and collaboration skills to become a well-rounded professional. With integrity, perseverance, and a growth 
   mindset, I’m on a mission to turn ideas into meaningful solutions and leave a positive mark on the world through technology.
